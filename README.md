This is a simple demonstration of how to build counters using Vue
## Project setup
Clone this directory, cd into the cloned project and then run
```
npm install
```

### To run the project locally
```
npm run serve
```
This should fire up the app at localhost:8080, though do note the port number in the console in case 8080 is not available

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
